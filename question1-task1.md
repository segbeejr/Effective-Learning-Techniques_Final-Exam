In Week 1 of the Effective Learning Techniques course, I basically learned about the importance of adaptability and self-awareness relative to the two types of thinking modes and procrastination in the learning process. These lessons can be highly valuable for my internship at Google Zurich. 

I will acknowledge my current skill gaps and accept that learning is a continuous process. Although I do not have extensive experience with tools like TensorFlow, Go, and Dart, but the key lesson is to embrace my learning journey with a growth mindset. The course might have emphasized the significance of metacognition, understanding how mylearn best. 

This can be applied by continuously assessing my learning progress, identifying my strengths and weaknesses, and adjusting my approach. Additionally, the importance of practice, feedback, and setting clear learning goals should guide my strategy in preparing for this internship.
