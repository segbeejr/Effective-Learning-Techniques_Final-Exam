To increase my chances of getting a return offer and succeeding in Zurich, I will create a comprehensive learning strategy by setting clear, measurable goals for my software engineering skills improvement. I will dedicate time after my official working hours, breaking my learning into manageable tasks. Embrace the environment in Zurich by engaging with natives, trying to learn Swiss German, and using English as a bridge language.

I will also make use of Google's TensorFlow and other tools in practical projects. Trying to gaing as much experience as possible and building real-world applications will solidify my learning. I will also incorperate the idea of seeking regular feedback from my colleagues, mentors, and my own self-assessment as I gathered in my week 1 of Effective Learning Techniques. I will also try to always rework/improve my strategy based on what works best for you. While the course's general learning techniques apply, I know that my situation is highly practical and specific, so I will focus on applying these techniques within the context of software engineering and the tools I will be using.
