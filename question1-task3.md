Assuming my working hours are from 8 am to 5:30 pm, I will allocate time for learning in the evening and weekends, and my daily schedule will balance my learning, practicalizing what I learned, and adaptation culturally.
Below is how my schedule will be:

Evenings (Weekdays):
5:45 pm - 7:15 pm: Review work, set learning objectives, and plan tasks.

7:20 pm - 9:20 pm: Learn and Practice TensorFlow, Go, and Dart.

9:25 pm - 10:25 pm: Pay keen attention to learning the Swiss German language.

Weekends:
Morning: interact with native speakers of Swiss German to practice language skills acquired through learning.

Afternoon: Real-world software projects.

Evening: Reflect on my learning progress and adjust my strategy.
